# Cloud Icons API Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the Cloud Icons API project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## API Improvements

### Architecture and Structure
- [x] Implement proper environment configuration management with dotenv
- [x] Refactor the API routes to be consistent (remove '/api' prefix in routes definition)
- [x] Move the getIconWithCache function from index.ts to the iconService
- [x] Create a proper error handling middleware
- [x] Implement request validation middleware using a library like joi or zod
- [x] Add proper logging with a structured logger (winston/pino) instead of console.log
- [x] Implement proper health checks with database/redis connectivity verification

### Performance and Caching
- [x] Optimize SVG resizing logic to be more efficient
- [x] Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed icons
- [x] Add ETag support for better client-side caching
- [x] Implement compression for all responses
- [x] Add cache headers for static assets

### Security
- [x] Implement proper input validation for all API endpoints
- [x] Add rate limiting per API key rather than just IP
- [x] Implement API key authentication for higher rate limits
- [x] Add SVG sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- [x] Implement proper CORS configuration with specific origins
- [x] Add security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- [x] Add unit tests for all service functions
- [x] Add integration tests for API endpoints
- [x] Implement a CI / CD pipeline with automated testing
- [x] Add code coverage reporting
- [x] Implement linting and code formatting with ESLint and Prettier
- [x] Add pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality
