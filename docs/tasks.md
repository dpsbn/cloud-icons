- [x] Create a proper error handling middleware
- [x] Implement request validation middleware using a library like joi or zod
- [x] Add proper logging with a structured logger (winston/pino) instead of console.log
- [x] Implement proper health checks with database/redis connectivity verification

### Performance and Caching

- [x] Optimize SVG resizing logic to be more efficient

- [x] Implement compression for all responses
- [x] Add cache headers for static assets

### Security

- [x] Implement proper input validation for all API endpoints
- [x] Add rate limiting per API key rather than just IP
- [x] Implement API key authentication for higher rate limits
